New features
* Server-side calculated fields: now it’s possible to add calculated fields to the forms specifying a mathematical formula using the existing form fields.
* Indexes: indexes are used to search and discover duplicated records based on a combination of one or more fields that are expected to be unique.
* User Permission: the web application has now a complete redesigned security check to deny access to resources based on user roles. Users can now be associated to view or edit only form responses that contains a specific value in a specific field.
* Custom Filter: it’s possible to define custom advanced filter on view and export data function.
* Data Edit: it’s possible to edit form responses using the same interface of web data entry.
* Data Review Workflow: responses can be reviewed and any status change is recorded in the response history.


Improvements
All the heavy tasks have been refactored to support multiprocessor/multicore support to improve calculation speed and more use of RAM memory to reduce access to database. 
This changes guarantee an optimal load scalability.


Fixes
Response value field has been expanded from 255 to 4000 chars in order to avoid exceptions in data entry. 
If the input is longer than 4000 chars, it will be truncated.
