GRASP Reporting version 1.3.0
New Features:
1-	In Reports, add the ability to create Line Charts (new chart type, mainly uses with Date fields, to show the changes of results over time).
2-	In Surveys, add the ability to totally delete Form Responses. This functionality is disabled by default, and it can be enabled from Settings -> Roles -> Permissions section -> “Delete Form Response” permission (You have to be logged in by a SuperAdministrator user).
3-	In Settings -> Roles, add a new section “Permissions”. This section gives the super adminisrator users the ability to maintain the following three permissions: 
a.	Edit Form Response: to show the “Edit Data” button of the form response.
b.	Delete Form Response: to show the “Delete” action button in the form responses grid (Surverys -> View action -> Delete button under actions column in the grid).
c.	See Permissions Section: to show the Permissions section in the Roles page.
4-	Send the form status to Mobile, where the mobile now handles whether the form is no logner exists in the server, or deleted, or published with a new version.
5-	In Create a New Chart Pgae:
a.	Add the DATE and CheckBox questions in the aggregate field list.
6-	Implement a UI blugin to integrate the data collected using GRASP with the free open source web GIS application “GeoSDI”.
7-	Add last updated date column in the form responses, to show the last updated date of the response, which is either updated using the edit of submitted responses from GRASP Mobile, or using the Edit Data in GRASP Reporting.
8-	Handle editing of submitted form responses sent from GRASP Mobile, and update the last update date of the response.
Enhancements:
1-	If you want to send form responses from mobile devices, and process then again, now you have the ability to just move the form responses of the form from “processed” sub folder in “ResponseFiles” folder to the “incoming” sub folder, and process them again, rather than collecting all mobile devices, and send the responses again to the server. Note, when you process a response again, the response data will be updated, if you want to delete the old response and process it again, you have to delete the old response (Surverys -> View action -> Delete button under actions column in the grid), then process it again.
2-	In Create a New Chart Pgae:
a.	When selecting COUNT as aggregate function, hide the second field (Series field), because it is not needed.
b.	Only Show the “Custom Data Column Label” and the “Custom Series Column Label” fileds, when the user check to Show Tabular Data of the chart.
3-	In View Form page, by default shows the “Edit Data” button only for super administrators. This editing form response data permission can be allowed for other groups from Settings -> Roles -> Permissions section.
4-	Sends the received Form Reponses with deleted, or with new form version status directly to the “unknownForms” sub folder in “ResponseFiles” folder, and before processing them.
5-	In Surveys, sort the forms by the created date.
6-	Remove form responses with the deleted status from the map in GeoSDI (A free web GIS application integrated with GRASP).
7-	Change the Web data entry phone number from “+39000000000” to “+0000000000” (ten zeros).
8-	Enhance the handling of exceptions and errors.
9-	In Settings page, make the Roles Tab as the default one.
Fixes:
1-	In few cases, some forms could not be downloaded from Reporting.
2-	In few cases, Bar Charts shows an extra bar without a label.
3-	Sometimes, Bar charts do not show all data in the database.
4-	In Surveys -> Custom Filter, the ‘<=’ condition does not work.
5-	In Custom Filters, sometimes the summary on the right pane of numeric questions do not show the edited values.
6-	A bug in Reporting version 1.2.3, an error happens when you try to export an old form data with no GPS default question.
7-	In Create a New Chart Pgae, the table data do not appear with bar charts.
8-	When you edit a report and click on Delete Chart button the message is "This action will delete the selected report. Are you sure?" Replace "report" with "chart".
